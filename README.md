# Microsoft Graph API Connect Sample for Python

Connecting to Office 365 is the first step every app must take to start working
with Office 365 services and data. This sample shows how to connect and then
call one API through the Microsoft Graph API (previously called Office 365
unified API), and uses the Office Fabric UI to create an Office 365 experience.

## Prerequisites

To use the Microsoft Graph API Connect sample for Python, you need the following:
* [Python 3.5.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* [Flask-OAuthlib](https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib)
* [Flask-Script 0.4](http://flask-script.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
* [Requests module](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
* A [Microsoft account](https://www.outlook.com/) or an [Office 365 for business account](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/office365/howto/setup-development-environment#bk_Office365Account)

> Note: Microsoft has tested the [Flask-OAuthlib](https://github.com/lepture/flask-oauthlib) library in basic scenarios and confirmed that it works with the v2.0 endpoint. Microsoft does not provide fixes for this library and has not done a review of it. Issues and feature requests should be directed to the libraryâ€™s open-source project.
